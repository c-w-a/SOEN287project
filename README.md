## Features Implemented:
-We were able to implement only a few features as we are pretty new to web development. 
Here is a list of features we implemented on the client side, and by who it was done:


Here is a list of features we implemented on the business side, and by who it was done:
- Created adminProfile, which displays the information relating to the business, their business name, number, email, and address. It also allows for the admin to modify the data within. Done by Navpreet, inspired by code done by Lyne and Azmain..
- Created adminServices.html, which contains all the services that the business offers. The business can then add, modify or edit the services offered. Consulted sources which shall be listed soon. Worked on by Navpreet and Lyne.
- Created adminSignIn.html which is a page allowing the business to decide what to do once logged in. They can choose to edit their profile information, delete their account, check out the services they offer, etc. Done by Navpreet, inspired by code done by Lyne and Azmain.
- created adminSignUP.html, which allows a business to signup for an admin account. Done by Navpreet, inspired by code done by Lyne and Azmain.
- created adminportal.html which is the login page for the admin. Worked on by Chris and Navpreet.

## Features To Be Implemented For Next Deliverable:
Business Side
- Will need to create an array to store the business data given by admin in adminProfile, so that this data can then be used to display it on the website.
- will need to optimize the code a bit, make sure no repetitiveness.
- will need to make the styling cohesive throughout the website.
- Implement a feature that will follow up with clients who have not paid their bill yet.
- implement a feature that will display past orders at any selected time of all or any customer(s).
- implement a feature that will confirm a service requested by the customer.
